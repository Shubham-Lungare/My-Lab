Description:

We created a VPC designed for hosting servers in a production environment. 
To enhance resiliency, the servers are deployed across two Availability Zones, using an Auto Scaling group to scale based on demand and an Application Load Balancer to evenly distribute traffic. 
For added security, the servers are placed in private subnets and receive incoming requests only through the load balancer. 
Outbound internet access is provided via a NAT gateway, which is deployed in both Availability Zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Private subnet can be accessible via Bastion host to enhance security of private subnet app/instance.

Steps:

1. Create VPC (Ipv4 CICD block, AZ's =2, public subnet=2, private subnet=2, NAT gateway= 1 per AZ)
2. Ec2 via autoscaling group(launch template)in private subnets.
3. Create Bastion host in public subnet to connect Ec2 Instance.
4. Install app in Ec2 instance.
	a.Connect to Bastion from local terminal(MobaXterm): Securely copy .pem file to Bastion so we can connect to Private subnet Ec2 instance.
		scp -i /drives/c/Users/ShubhamL/Downloads/awslogin.pem /drives/c/Users/ShubhamL/Downloads/awslogin.pem ubuntu@13.222.199.253:/home/ubuntu
        b.Login to bastion:
		ssh -i awslogin.pem ubuntu@13.222.199.253
	c.Login to Ec2:
		ssh -i awslogin.pem ubuntu@15.222.198.112
	d.Create sample.html webpage 
		vim index.html
	e.Run python server
		python3 -m http.server 8000
5. Create Application Load balancer(Https: Layer7 of OSI): select VPC,AZ's,Public subnets, Security group, Inbound allow for custom : 8000 and HTTP :80 Listerns and routing port :80 default {create target group and select Ec2[app]}
6. Access DNS name from internet.

App(web page) is installed one EC2 only to see Target group option as Healthy and Unhealthy trafiic forward.
